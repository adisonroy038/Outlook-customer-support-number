Outlook continually prompts for your password when you try to connect to Microsoft 365

Sometimes when we try to connect Microsoft 365 mailbox or even when we try to create a profile, we get an error:  The connection to Microsoft Exchange is unavailable. Outlook must be online or connected to complete this action.
The reason is that the Logon network security setting on the Security tab of the Microsoft Exchange dialog box is set to a value other than Anonymous Authentication.
Resolution:
<b><a href="https://iguruservices.com/support">Microsoft Outlook</a></b> 2016 and some recent builds of Outlook 2013 are not affected by this issue. Those versions have been updated to prevent the problem described in the "Symptoms" section. These versions have the Logon network security setting disabled or removed from the Microsoft Exchange email account settings.
